## Abstract

Wilson’s disease (WD) is a condition of copper accumulation in the body, organs such as liver and brain, which is recessively caused by an autosomal chromosome.

## Background

Symptoms of Wilson's disease may vary from individual to individual; however, common symptoms are neurological and psychiatric, liver related and urinary problems as most of the copper accumulation affects brain, liver and kidney tissues.

## Proposal

The gene on the 13th chromosome ATP7B codes for the copper-transporting enzyme P-type ATPase 2, of which the deficiency of it causes Wilson’s disease. Copper is an important part of certain enzymes that maintain normal cell function. Copper-transporting ATPase 2 is mostly found in the liver although it is also found in the kidneys and brain in smaller amounts. Its primary function is to transport copper from the liver to other parts of the body, and removal of excess copper from the cells. In the search for the cause of this disease, more than 100 mutations had been identified to find the mutation that causes the abnormality. As some variants of the gene ATP7B are identified as benign or pathogenic, some variants of the aforementioned gene are still unknown in terms of their significance of coding fully functioning ATPase 2 protein.
In the light of the collected information of the chosen article, the sequence of ATP7B gene will be BLASTed to in order to find homologous sequences of the gene. With this data, MSA will be run to provide information to form a phylogenetic tree and identify the conserved/variant regions. Furthermore, positional conservation score of the gene will be calculated to be able to identify if a VUS is more likely to be pathogenic or neutral.
