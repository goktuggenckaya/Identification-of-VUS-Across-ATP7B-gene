Protein sequences obtained through BLAST analysis were aligned using the MEGA11 program. Aligned sequences were then analyzed to identify conserved amino acid positions among species carrying the homologous ATP7B gene. The conservation rate of these positions was calculated using the entropy calculation method, which allows for the quantification of amino acid changes of unknown significance. This method was adopted from a previously published source by Pei, J., & Grishin, N. V. (2020).

Using the aforementioned code, 60 sample single nucleotide mutations with unknown significance were analyzed and a table was created, which is containing various features of these mutations, including the criticality of the amino acid position in which the mutation occurred, the specific nucleotide replacements, and the resulting change in the polarity/charge of the replaced amino acid. This polarity/charge change was classified into four categories: polar, non-polar, positively charged, and negatively charged. It is important to note that even a mutation in a conserved region, as calculated by the "pos_conserv.py" code, may not be pathogenic if the replaced amino acids are of the same polarity/charge category. Of the 60 mutations resulting in amino acid replacement, 26 were calculated to potentially have critical significance, while 12 involved a change in polarity/charge. This latter group is more likely to affect the protein's 3-dimensional structure and, subsequently, its functionality.



As an example, a reported mutation (Leu1371Arg) that had occurred in the 1371st amino acid position in the original sequence, which is a Leucine to Arginine substitution, changes this position’s charge from non-polar to positively charged. “Ser1369Leu” demonstrate a substitution of Serine as Leucine and the charge changes from polar to non-polar. Another substitution, Gly1355Asp, is an example of non-polar to negatively charged amino acid change. All these mutations have a higher probablity of affecting the protein’s 3D structure since there is a change in the amino acids’ charge which is crucial for a protein’s folding mechanism.


A graph has been plotted to depict the relationship between the amino acid position and the entropy score. This graph, which can be seen above, illustrates regions of relatively low entropy, including some near-ground-level regions, which may suggest the crucial role of these regions in the healthy functioning of ATP7B. However, it is important to note that this graph provides a general overview of the distribution of conserved regions and may not be sufficient to fully understand the importance of these regions in maintaining the protein's primary function and its role in vital biological processes, such as copper transport.
